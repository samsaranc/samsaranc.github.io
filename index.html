							<h2>At the convergence of CS, Math, and Writing</h2>
						</header>
                        <p>I am a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Amazon Web Services, working on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/clarify/">SageMaker Clarify</a>. SageMaker Clarify offers ML bias detection and explainability methods for machine learning models, datasets, and artifacts hosted on AWS.<br><br>
                       
                        Previously, I was a Citizen Ambassador and Fellow of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young Professionals (CBYX).
                        As a Fellow, I represented the U.S. in Germany for a year-long cultural exchange program sponsored by the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag. 
                        During my fellowship, I was a research intern at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems with <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/">Dr. Krishna Gummadi</a>, focusing on ethical interventions for computer science and AI research/projects.<br><br>
                        	
			            I attended George Washington University and double-majored in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Creative Writing.
                        At GW, I worked with <a href="http://www.robertpless.com/">Robert Pless</a> using deep learning to recognize eating disorder content and designing applications for the public to promote wellness. I've also worked on a project to promote fairness and diversity in the hiring process with Reinforcement Learning, advised by <a href="http://www.jpdickerson.com/"> John P. Dickerson</a>.
      	                 In Summer 2018, I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/">Microsoft Research New England</a> with <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/">Henry Cohn</a>, using group theory to speed up matrix multiplication algorithms.
      	                 <br><br>
						My research interests are broadly in the realm of artificial intelligence, including graph theory, learning theory,  algorithms, and algorithmic fairness. I enjoy working on research projects with a theoretical focus as well as ones that aim to promote social good (bonus points for projects that accomplish both!). 
      	                 <br><br>
      	                 During Summer 2017, I  worked at UMD's <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">REU CAAR</a> on a project modeling kidney exchange as a RL problem, advised by <a href="http://www.jpdickerson.com/">John P. Dickerson</a>.
      	                 In 2017, I studied online harassment and creating tools to combat it with technology, funded by a grant from Intel called <a href="https://www.hackharassment.com/winners-2016-hackharassment-grants/">Hack Harassment</a>. 
                        In Summer 2016, I contributed to a project using NLP to generate reading comprehension tools for low-literacy adults in GW's <a href="http://letr.seas.gwu.edu/"> Learning Technologies Research Group</a>.
                        In my free time, I <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/samsarac">read incessantly</a> and write <a href="pubs.html">poetry</a> + fiction.</p>
