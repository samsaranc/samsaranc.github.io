							<h2>At the convergence of CS, Math, and Writing</h2>
						</header>
                        <p>I am a Data Scientist at Amazon, working on abuse detection and upholding trust in the Amazon retail site, part of the Community Trust org. <!-- with a focus on implementing Responsible AI best practices.-->
                        My research interests are broadly in responsible AI, including algorithmically modeling (un)fairness/interpretability/diversity and the foundational processes of implementing RAI in ML systems (Responsible MLOps).
                        From the theoretical side, I particularly like graph theory, learning theory, and algorithms.
      	                <br><br>

                        While at Amazon, I've been a Machine Learning Software Engineer, working on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/clarify/">AWS SageMaker Clarify</a>, which offers bias detection and explainability methods for ML models and datasets hosted on AWS.
                        Prior to that, I worked for the Secure AI Foundations Privacy org in Alexa AI, deploying ML models to detect and redact PII/PD in the Alexa ecosystem.
                        <br><br>
                       
                        Before starting at Amazon, I was a Junior Ambassador and Fellow of the <a href="https://culturalvistas.org/programs/abroad/congress-bundestag-youth-exchange-young-professionals/">Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young Professionals (CBYX)</a>.
                        As a Fellow, I represented the U.S. in Germany for a year-long cultural exchange program sponsored by the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag. 
                        During my fellowship, I was a Research Intern at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems with <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/">Krishna Gummadi</a>, focusing on ethical interventions for Machine Learning projects.<br><br>
                        
			            I attended George Washington University, graduating with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Creative Writing. Along the way, I'm grateful to have worked on a variety of projects with some amazing mentors, most in the realm of AI for Social Good:
		
			            <ul>
	                        <li>At GW, I worked with <a href="http://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/index.php">Robert Pless</a> using deep learning to recognize pro-eating disorder (ED) content and designing applications to help ED patients in recovery.</li>

	                        <li>I've also worked on a project using multi-armed bandits to promote diversity when selecting a cohort of job applicants (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03441">AAMAS 2019</a>) and learning optimal matching policies for kidney exchange at UMD's <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">REU CAAR</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.jpdickerson.com/"> John P. Dickerson</a>.</li>

	      	                <li>In Summer 2018, I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/">Microsoft Research New England</a> with <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/">Henry Cohn</a>, using group theory to speed up matrix multiplication algorithms.</li>

	      	                <li>In 2017, I studied online harassment and creating tools to combat it with technology, funded by a grant from Intel called Hack Harassment.</li>
	      	                
	      	                <!-- <a href="https://www.hackharassment.com/winners-2016-hackharassment-grants/">Hack Harassment</a>.  -->
	                        <li>In Summer 2016, I contributed to a project using NLP to generate reading comprehension tools for low-literacy adults in GW's Learning Technologies Research Group.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <!-- <a href="http://letr.seas.gwu.edu/">  -->
                        In my free time, I read incessantly, write <a href="pubs.html">poetry</a> + fiction, and learn (foreign to me) languages.</p>
