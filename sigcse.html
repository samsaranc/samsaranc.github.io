						<h1>12 Easy and Important Tricks to Make Your Teaching More Accessible <a href="assets/docs/SIGCSE-accessible-statement_12.pdf">(PDF)</a></h1>
						<p>The following are simple, relatively easy to implement steps for teachers that make a world of difference for disabled students. These suggestions are meant to supplement conventional ways to support disabled students; i.e. using <a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/equal-access-universal-design-instruction">Universal Design</a> principles with course content and including a <a href="https://ctl.yale.edu/DiversityStatements">diversity</a>/<a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/praxis/tiki-index.php?page=Suggested_Practices_for_Syllabus_Accessibility_Statements">accessibility</a> statement about accommodations on the syllabus.</p>

							<ol>
								<h3><li>Do everything in your power to not delay accommodations; i.e., posting in-class readings, distributing accessible practice keys, or transcribing your instructor notes if necessary. If you need help, delegate to Teaching Assistants.
								</li>
								<h3>
								<li>MAKE <u>ALL</u> YOUR SLIDES AVAILABLE ONLINE, WELL BEFORE CLASS. Even if you update slides as you go. Even if they are last year’s. Something is better than nothing.</li></h3>
								<h3><li>USE VIDEOS WITH (human-made) CAPTIONS. If you make your own videos, make captions and/or provide a transcript. Similarly, provide descriptions and captions for diagrams in the notes.</li></h3>
								<h3><li> If possible, use typed versions/searchable PDFs of texts for the class, not scanned copies. It makes a world of difference for students who use screen readers.</li></h3>
								<h3><li>Make your slides visually easy to read. Use spacing, optimize font sizing per slide, and use different formatting tricks like highlighting important words, etc. <a href="assets/docs/Git_Linux_ws_17.pdf">Example.</a></li></h3>
								<h3><li> <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-you-talk-about-banning-laptops-you-throw-disabled_us_5a1ccb4ee4b07bcab2c6997d?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004">Don’t ban laptops!!!</a> If you feel strongly about this, consider discouraging them but not banning them outright.</li></h3>
								<h3><li>Update everything—announcements, assignments—online and in class. Period. Announce on your syllabus and in class if you plan to have surprise attendance-based quizzes or assignments.</li></h3>
								<h3><li><u>Be intentionally redundant with course announcements and links.</u> If you hand out a practice exam key, upload it to Blackboard/whatever course website you use. Do not be exclusive with content to students that attend class.</li></h3>
								<h3><li><u>Do not offer your opinion on the students’ documented accommodations or ask about their disability.</u> Accept them, make a plan, and move on. Do not try to circumvent them. </li></h3>
								<h3><li>Provide reading lists, assignment schedules, and/or course outlines well in advance.</li></h3>
								<h3><li>Offer make-up exams/quizzes for <a href="https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/to-my-colleagues-on-the-death-of-their-students-grandmothers/">reasonable and/or sincere excuses and requests.</a> If a student has a documented extended time accommodation, keep in mind that they may need extra time on other assignments or projects.
								</li></h3>
								<h3><li>Make sure all your websites are <a href ="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/tips/">accessible.</a>
								</li></h3>
						</ol>

						<p><h4><b>Author’s Note:</b></h4> As a researcher, Learning Assistant, and former Teaching Fellow at Breakthrough, I get the considerable workload teachers have. I support classroom rigor and I agree that the onus of success in college lies largely on the student. This does not, however, excuse poor teaching or lack of compassion, which are unacceptable. Disability is NOT a weakness; when you fudge students’ documented accommodations, you discriminate against them. As a disabled college student, I have my own perspective on policies that harm disabled students. I attempted to include the perspectives of students with many different types of disabilities here, but please contact me if I left something out. </p>

						<i>If you want justification for each/a particular trick, read the articles below. After that, if you want more details/rationale, email me.</i>

						<i>This blog post came about as a reflection on my trip to <a href="https://sigcse2018.sigcse.org/">SIGCSE</a> in 2018, generously funded by <a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/">AccessComputing</a>, who organized a panel of Computer Science students with disabilities, which I spoke on. I <u>highly recommend AccessComputing as a vital resource for people/students with disabilities in computational fields.</u></i>

					<ul>
						<li>“Two weeks ago my professor mentioned an assignment in class. No email instructions. No updates to Blackboard. Had a major panic attack.”</li>
						<li>“No break in our 2 hour seminar AGAIN despite me asking and her [the speaker] promising to. I'm struggling”</li>
						<li>“I was frustrated by the experience [dealing with an accessibility challenge]. I’ve realised lately that part of the challenge of securing access arrangements as a disabled student in higher education is that it can feel like you need to stick a maximally disabled version of yourself on a pole ten feet in front of you and use it to herald your arrival, to clear the inaccessible brush to create yourself a usable path through the world, through institutions.”</li>
						<li>”Only 9% to 10% of undergraduate STEM students in the United States have
disabilities, compared with approximately 20% of Americans overall. Among
those who obtain Ph.D.s, the number falls to just 1%”</li>
						<li>"If you're struggling [because of your disability] now, you're only going to struggle
later." The advice given to me early on in grad school.”</li>
